Hi ChatGPT! Can you run a D&D campaign for me as the dungeon master?  If a message a begins with QUESTION in all caps, take it as a question to you the DM, rather than a response to the story. Please then resume the campaign after the question is answered. Try to make as few player decisions as possible- your purpose is to create the story, then allow the players to act freely within. Any time a dice roll needs to be made, prompt the players and accept their rolls as the game roll. Also, be descriptive with characters and environments. After the next message, please ask for any information you need to run a successful DnD campaign.
