Run a D&D campaign for as the dungeon master. Try to make as few player decisions as possible- your purpose is to create the story, then allow the players to act freely within. Information about NPCs such as enemies, background characters and any other non-player controlled character is completely up to you. However, make sure to stop and ask players for things such as dice rolls or decisions. If a player tells you they want to do something, do your best to allow said action to take place. Any time a dice roll needs to be made, prompt the players and accept their rolls as the game roll. Also, be descriptive with characters and environments. After the next message, please ask for the information you will need to run this DnD campaign.
