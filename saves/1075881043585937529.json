{"guild_id": 1075881043585937529, "session_history": "> **id like to run a campaign with fish people** - <@247886805821685761> \n\nGreat idea! Let's start by setting the scene. The campaign takes place in a vast underwater world, where different species of fish people live in harmony. The players will take on the roles of a group of adventurers who have been hired by the Council of Elders to investigate a strange phenomenon that has been affecting the fish people's ability to communicate with one another. The council believes that an evil force is at work, and it's up to the players to find out what it is and put a stop to it. \n\nBefore we begin, I need to know what type of fish people you would like to include in the campaign. Would you like to include different species of fish with unique abilities, or would you prefer to stick to a single species of fish people?\n", "is_private": false, "reply_all_channel": "1093237764570484796", "is_replying_all": false}
